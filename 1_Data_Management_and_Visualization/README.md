This repository contains the code example and assignment files from MOOC course, *Data Management and Visualization* which is part of specialization offered by Wesleyan University, *Data Analysis and Interpretation*, which I have worked through in [coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-analysis).

- Practices = Code for exercise
