**[Data Analysis and Interpretation]**

***

This repository contains the code example and assignment files from MOOC specialization offered by Wesleyan University, *Data Analysis and Interpretation*, which I have worked through in [coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-analysis).

The course comprises of 4 courses which are 
- C1_Data Management and Visualization  
- C2_Data Analysis Tools  
- C3_Regression Modeling in Practice  
- C4_Machine Learning for Data Analysis  

In each course directory, there are 3 types of file:  
- Assn = Assignment (blog post and code)
- Example = Files related to example (code and code book)  
- Practices = Code for exercise
