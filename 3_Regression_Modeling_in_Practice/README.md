**[Regression Modeling in Practice]**

***

This repository contains the code example and assignment files from MOOC course, *Regression Modeling in Practice* which is part of specialization offered by Wesleyan University, *Data Analysis and Interpretation*, which I have worked through in [coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-analysis).

The course comprises of 4 modules which are 
- M1_Introduction to Regression ([Assignment](http://smallpiworld.tumblr.com/post/147837072805/regression-modeling1-writing-about-data))  
- M2_Basic of Linear Regression ([Assignment](http://smallpiworld.tumblr.com/post/148150331860/regression-modeling2-basic-linear-regression))  
- M3_Multiple Regression ([Assignment](http://smallpiworld.tumblr.com/post/148537901680/regression-modeling-3-multiple-regression))  
- M4_Logistic Regression ([Assignment](http://smallpiworld.tumblr.com/post/148936516685/regression-modeling-4-logistic-regression))  

In each module directory, there are 3 types of file:  
- Assn = Assignment (blog post and code)
- Example = Files related to example (code and code book)  
- Practices = Code for exercise
