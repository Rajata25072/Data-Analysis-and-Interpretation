**[Machine Learning for Data Analysis]**

***

This repository contains the code example and assignment files from MOOC course, *Machine Learning for Data Analysis* which is part of specialization offered by Wesleyan University, *Data Analysis Interpretation*, which I have worked through in [coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-analysis).

The course comprises of 4 modules which are 
- M1_Decision Tree ([Assignment](http://smallpiworld.tumblr.com/post/149545874110/machine-learning-1-decision-tree))  
- M2_Random Forest ([Assignment](http://smallpiworld.tumblr.com/post/149874520230/machine-learning-2-random-forest))  
- M3_Lasso Regression ([Assignment](http://smallpiworld.tumblr.com/post/150243310915/machine-learning-3-lasso-regression))  
- M4_K-Means Cluster Analysis ([Assignment](http://smallpiworld.tumblr.com/post/150354134255/machine-learning-4-k-means-cluster-analysis))  

In each module directory, there are 3 types of file:  
- Assn = Assignment (blog post and code)
- Example = Files related to example (code and code book)  
- Practices = Code for exercise
