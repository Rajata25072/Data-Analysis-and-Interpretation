This repository contains the code example and assignment files from MOOC course, *Data Analysis Tools* which is part of specialization offered by Wesleyan University, *Data Analysis and Interpretation*, which I have worked through in [coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-analysis).

The course comprises of 4 modules which are

- M4_Exploring Statistical Interactions ([Assignment](http://smallpiworld.tumblr.com/post/147743197615/data-analysis-tools4-pearson-correlation-with))  

In each module directory, there are 3 types of file:  
- Assn = Assignment (blog post and code)
- Example = Files related to example (code and code book)  
- Practices = Code for exercise
