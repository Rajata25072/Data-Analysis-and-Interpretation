**[Chi Square Test of Independence]**

***

This session shows you how to test hypotheses in the context of a Chi-Square Test of Independence (when you have two categorical variables). Your task will be to write a program that manages any additional variables you may need and runs and interprets a Chi-Square Test of Independence. Note that if your research question only includes quantitative variables, you can categorize those just to get some practice with the tool.
